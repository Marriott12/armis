## Overview
This document records the files that were removed from the Armis system on August 2, 2025, as part of a cleanup process to optimize the system and remove unused files.

## Restoration
A backup of all files was created at `c:\wamp64\www\Armis2_backup\` before deletion. However, restoration of these files is not recommended as they are not needed for the system's operation.

If you need to reference any of the deleted files for documentation purposes, please check the backup.

## Impact
The removal of these files has:
- Reduced system clutter
- Improved security by removing testing code
- Simplified the codebase
- Reduced maintenance overhead

No functional impact is expected as all removed files were non-essential to the system's operation.

## Contact
If you have questions about this cleanup, please contact the system administrator.
